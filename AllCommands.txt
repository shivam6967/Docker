# PORT MAPPING 

docker run -it -p:8080:1220 <image_name>

-- the image running in the container , here the port is also in container , if we check in our browser it will show error , here we have to map the port 

here we have mapped the port with 8080 -> 1220 
now we can check 8080 running in our machine , we give any port as we need
